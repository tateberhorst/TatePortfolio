          <figcaption class="figure-caption">My name is Tate Berhorst. I am a full-blooded Korean, although my last name says otherwise. My last name was adopted, as my father, Steve Berhorst, was adopted. I am always excited to do new things, and I have well-rounded skills.

            <p>At this time, I am a student currently attending Dublin High School. Through my time in school, I have developed many skills and interests which stem from the classes and scenarios I am put in every day in my academic life. To succeed, I found that I need social skills and dedication. Personally, I believe that skills are developed over time, and that a lot of what you learn is from doing things, and not much information is retained from just studying.
                <br>
                <br>
            For this, I need all of the skills in which I had listed above. As of now, I am adept at all of them because of the social and connective environment I was raised in. I have adequate speaking skills, which I have used many times in my academic life for speeches and presentations, while also using them in casual talk outside of work to peak interests of new people.
                <br>
                <br>
            During my life, I have been dedicated to the piano for over 5 years. I also spend lots of time practicing lacrosse whenever the sports season comes around, and I attend all known practices. From these I learned dedication, sticking with something even if I have a rough time because later I would become much more skilled. Outside of school, I like to communicate with friends while helping people with errands, as well as find ways to spend as much time with friends as possible.
                <br>
                <br>
            To end off, I am rather interested in the Biology field, along with any other form of sciences. I believe that communication is key in the science field, along with a lot of dedication, as the science field is one of the most difficult fields to pursue. I believe that with the skills I have learned, I can pursue my interest to work in science.
