            <p><strong>Project:</strong> Block Jump</p>
            <p><strong>Course:</strong> Computer Science Principles</p>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Create a game using the coding blocks given through Scratch
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Roughly 1 and a half or 2 days</p>

            <p>This was one of the first projects that I was assigned in CSP. The game has a platformer theme, so it requires you, the player, to navigate your character through obstacles. The controls use a simple W-A-S-D movement, and the game factors both gravity and wall jumping to allow for an interesting experience. This game's goal is simple, touch the red wall on the opposite side. This game came with its obstacles of course. This was a partner project, therefore it tested my teamworking skills. I successfully was able to work well and befriend my partner, and the rest of the project was done with efficient synergy. Of course, one of our greatest issues was figuring out how to simulate gravity in a platform like Scratch. Over time, we had our trials and errors but we managed to actually succeed. It is a proud example of us as a team overcoming obstacles in unlikely circumstances.
